        <h1>About</h1>
        <p>Hi, my name is Florian, a software developer living between Japan and Thailand.</p>
        <p>
            Throughout my career, I have developed web services, desktop applications and worked on
            embeddded devices.
        </p>
        <p>
            I also have experience in managing small teams of developers and designers as I founded
            and managed a small software development company in Japan for 7 years, which I sold in
            2017.
        </p>
        <p>
            For the past 6 years, I have been working fully remote as a freelancer for various
            clients in the field of IOT, E-Commerce and Hardware development.
        </p>
        <p>
            On a more personal note, I'm a 42yo French citizen living between Bangkok and Tokyo
            since 2008, married to a Japanese national and proud father of a 9 year old daughter. I
            can speak French (Native), English (Fluent) and Japanese (Conversational). I love
            running, drumming and programming.
        </p>
